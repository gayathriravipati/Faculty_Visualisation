The traffic lights on Silver Bluff Road from the intersection of Pine Log Road to Dougherty Road are out due to a down powerline. There are reports also of power outages in the immediate area of the bypass, however, the exact impacted areas are not confirmed.  

Road closures with barricades will be at Hitchcock Pkwy and Oriole St, Silver Bluff Rd and Old Towne, and Pine Log Rd near Kroger heading towards the bypass.  Please avoid the entire area and seek alternative routes of travel as the road closures are expected to last for several hours.",https://www.facebook.com/aikendps/posts/pfbid02mqrougBnEwo9r2tsZL6C2Lpzt2vYyFui5jMfJi1AkZbysBcq8kTnU8ZDV8aDXjqFl
power,"Due to extremely cold temperatures and power demands, Santee Cooper, power and transmission supplier of Aiken Electric Cooperative (AEC), and other statewide cooperatives is urging members to decrease energy usage, as we are experiencing record demand on our electrical system. The next few hours are critical. If there is any way you can reduce usage at your home by curtailing activities that use power including heating load, water heating, or other activities it would be helpful. Again the demand for power is at a critical level so we appreciate anything you can do to reduce your individual usage. 

Widespread power outages are not expected, but small 30 minute localized outages may occur if the load continues to increase.  Here are some tips to help keep power usage down.

Thank you for your help!",https://www.facebook.com/AikenElectricCooperative/posts/pfbid02jFawja2nxvdCkeSeXTGY1RxT1jcats9uB7Ghbz8exdCKjiRM8AvEsKUVk94oV7nFl
